Quick question…

This week, as part of our “Employee Appreciation Bonanza,” I have 15
big snack boxes filled with 15 delicious better-for-you snacks to give to
cool companies, and yours really stands out.

Do you know who is in charge of snacks at your office?  Would you mind
forwarding this message please?

Here are more details: http://snacksfortheoffice.store/snackbox

I really appreciate your help.  Thank you!

- Melissa
